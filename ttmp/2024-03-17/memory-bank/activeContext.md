# Active Context

## Current Focus
We are implementing a flexible command filter system using Bleve as the search backend. The core functionality is complete, and we are now focusing on:

1. Performance Optimization
   - Testing with large command sets
   - Optimizing wildcard queries
   - Implementing caching strategies
   - Fine-tuning index configuration

2. Logging and Debugging
   - Implementing structured logging with zerolog
   - Adding detailed debug logging for query operations
   - Improving error reporting and tracing
   - Enhancing development debugging experience

3. CLI Integration
   - Adding filter subcommand
   - Implementing filter flags
   - Adding output formatting
   - Improving error reporting

## Recent Changes

1. Logging Enhancement
   - Replaced fmt.Printf with structured zerolog.Debug() calls
   - Added detailed logging in command document creation
   - Improved logging in index creation and search operations
   - Enhanced path filtering operation logging
   - Added structured fields for better debugging

2. Core Implementation
   - Implemented flexible command filter system
   - Created fluent builder API
   - Added comprehensive field mappings
   - Fixed name pattern queries
   - Added proper analyzers for all fields

3. Testing
   - Added unit tests for all components
   - Added integration tests for complex queries
   - Verified field mappings and analyzers
   - Tested with diverse command sets

## Active Decisions

1. Logging Strategy
   - Using zerolog for structured logging
   - Debug level for detailed operation tracing
   - Structured fields for better filtering
   - Consistent logging patterns across components

2. Field Mappings
   - Using keyword analyzer for exact match fields (name, type, tags)
   - Using standard analyzer for text fields
   - Using dynamic mapping for metadata fields
   - Storing all fields for retrieval

3. Query Building
   - Using fluent builder API for query construction
   - Supporting all common query types
   - Allowing complex boolean combinations
   - Providing helper methods for common patterns

## Next Steps

1. Short Term
   - Complete performance testing with large datasets
   - Create migration guide
   - Start CLI integration

2. Medium Term
   - Implement caching mechanism
   - Add CLI documentation
   - Improve error handling

3. Long Term
   - Add advanced query features
   - Optimize for large-scale usage
   - Enhance developer experience

## Current Considerations

1. Logging and Debugging
   - Monitor logging performance impact
   - Consider log level configuration
   - Evaluate logging verbosity
   - Plan log aggregation strategy

2. Query Performance
   - Monitor performance of wildcard queries
   - Consider indexing strategies for large command sets
   - Evaluate caching options for frequent queries

3. Path Handling
   - Maintain consistent path format
   - Handle edge cases (empty paths, special characters)
   - Consider platform-specific path separators
