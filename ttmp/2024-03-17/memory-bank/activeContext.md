# Active Context

## Current Focus
We are implementing a flexible command filter system using Bleve as the search backend. The core functionality is complete, and we are now focusing on:

1. Performance Optimization
   - Testing with large command sets
   - Optimizing wildcard queries
   - Implementing caching strategies
   - Fine-tuning index configuration

2. Migration Support
   - Creating migration guide
   - Testing backward compatibility
   - Documenting breaking changes
   - Providing migration examples

3. CLI Integration
   - Adding filter subcommand
   - Implementing filter flags
   - Adding output formatting
   - Improving error reporting

## Recent Changes

1. Core Implementation
   - Implemented flexible command filter system
   - Created fluent builder API
   - Added comprehensive field mappings
   - Fixed name pattern queries
   - Added proper analyzers for all fields

2. Testing
   - Added unit tests for all components
   - Added integration tests for complex queries
   - Verified field mappings and analyzers
   - Tested with diverse command sets

## Active Decisions

1. Field Mappings
   - Using keyword analyzer for exact match fields (name, type, tags)
   - Using standard analyzer for text fields
   - Using dynamic mapping for metadata fields
   - Storing all fields for retrieval

2. Query Building
   - Using fluent builder API for query construction
   - Supporting all common query types
   - Allowing complex boolean combinations
   - Providing helper methods for common patterns

3. Performance
   - Using in-memory Bleve index for now
   - Planning caching mechanism
   - Considering index optimization options
   - Evaluating query performance

## Next Steps

1. Short Term
   - Complete performance testing with large datasets
   - Create migration guide
   - Start CLI integration

2. Medium Term
   - Implement caching mechanism
   - Add CLI documentation
   - Improve error handling

3. Long Term
   - Add advanced query features
   - Optimize for large-scale usage
   - Enhance developer experience

## Current Considerations
1. Query Performance
   - Monitor performance of wildcard queries
   - Consider indexing strategies for large command sets
   - Evaluate caching options for frequent queries

2. Path Handling
   - Maintain consistent path format
   - Handle edge cases (empty paths, special characters)
   - Consider platform-specific path separators

3. Testing Coverage
   - Add more complex path pattern tests
   - Test edge cases and error conditions
   - Benchmark query performance
