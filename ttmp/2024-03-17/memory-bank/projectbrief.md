# Command Filter System Project Brief

## Overview
Implement a flexible and efficient command filtering system for Clay using Bleve as the search backend. The system allows searching through CommandDescription objects using various criteria and boolean combinations.

## Core Requirements

1. **Search Capabilities**
   - Filter commands by type, name, path, and tags
   - Support exact matches and pattern matching
   - Enable metadata field filtering
   - Allow boolean combinations of filters (AND, OR, NOT)

2. **Performance**
   - Use in-memory Bleve index for fast searches
   - Support concurrent searches
   - Optimize for large command sets

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Provide a fluent builder interface for query construction
   - Support method chaining for filter combinations
   - Enable customization through builder options
   - Maintain backward compatibility during transition

4. **Integration**
   - Seamless integration with Clay's command system
   - Support for CLI interface
   - Consistent error handling
   - Context support for cancellation

## Success Criteria

1. **Functionality**
   - All filter types work as specified
   - Boolean combinations function correctly
   - Search results are accurate and complete
   - Error handling is robust

2. **Usability**
   - Builder API is intuitive and easy to use
   - Documentation is clear and comprehensive
   - Examples cover common use cases
   - Migration path is smooth

3. **Quality**
   - Comprehensive test coverage
   - Clean and maintainable code
   - Proper error handling
   - Well-documented interfaces
