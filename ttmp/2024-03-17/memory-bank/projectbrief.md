   - Tag-based filtering
   - Name pattern matching
   - Path-based filtering
   - Metadata matching
   - Boolean combinations

2. Performance
   - Fast query execution
   - Memory efficiency
   - Resource management
   - Query optimization

3. Developer Experience
   - Type-safe API
   - Fluent interface
   - Clear documentation
   - Helpful error messages

## Key Features

1. Query Building
   - Fluent builder API
   - Method chaining
   - Boolean operations
   - Helper methods

2. Field Mappings
