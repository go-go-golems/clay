- Added tests for complex nested queries
- Verified query structure and field mapping 

## Command Filter Document Tests

Added unit tests for command document conversion and validation.

- Added tests for CommandDescription to document conversion
- Added tests for document field validation
- Tested various edge cases and error conditions
- Verified field mapping and data integrity 

## Command Filter Integration Tests

Added integration tests for complex query combinations.

- Added tests for Type AND Tag combinations
- Added tests for Path-based combinations with glob patterns
- Added tests for Metadata combinations with multiple fields
- Verified search results with realistic command sets 

## Command Filter Complex Integration Tests

Added comprehensive integration tests for advanced query combinations.
