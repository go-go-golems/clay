# Command Filter Planning

Added initial plan for implementing a flexible command filter system that will allow searching through CommandDescription objects using various criteria and boolean combinations.

- Created TODO.md with detailed implementation plan
- Outlined core components including filter interfaces, implementations, and builder API
- Added testing and documentation plans 

# Simplified Bleve-Based Command Filter

Updated the architecture plan to use a simpler approach with transient in-memory indices.

- Simplified the implementation to focus on core functionality
- Removed complexity of persistent indices and advanced features
- Added clear upgrade path for future enhancements 

# Complete Command Filter Types

Updated the Bleve architecture plan to include implementations for all filter types from the original plan:

- Added all filter types (name, pattern, parents, type, tags, metadata)
- Included detailed examples for each filter type
- Added boolean combinations and metadata handling 

# Optimized Command Index Structure

Refactored the Bleve architecture to use a persistent in-memory index:

- Created CommandIndex type to manage the Bleve index
- Improved performance by reusing index for multiple searches
- Added support for concurrent searches
- Simplified usage with better examples 

# Updated Implementation Plan

Aligned TODO.md with the Bleve-based architecture:

- Restructured implementation plan around Bleve components
- Added detailed package structure and implementation steps
- Updated CLI integration plan with examples
- Added comprehensive testing strategy
